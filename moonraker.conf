[secrets]

[server]
host: 0.0.0.0
#  The host address in which to bind the HTTP server.  Default is to bind
#  to all ipv4 interfaces.  If set to "all" the server will bind to all
#  ipv4 an ipv6 interfaces.
port: 7125
#   The port the HTTP server will listen on.  Default is 7125
klippy_uds_address: /home/aspruyt/printer_data/comms/klippy.sock
#   The address of Unix Domain Socket used to communicate with Klippy. This
#   option accepts Jinja2 Templates, where the configured data path is
#   passed to the template context, for example:
#     klippy_uds_address: {data_path}/comms/klippy.sock
#
#   Default is /tmp/klippy_uds.
#max_upload_size: 1024
#   The maximum size allowed for a file upload (in MiB).  Default is 1024 MiB.
#enable_debug_logging: False
#   ***DEPRECATED***
#   Verbose logging is enabled by the '-v' command line option.

#[file_manager]
#queue_gcode_uploads: False
#   When set to True the file manager will add uploads to the job_queue when
#   the `start_print` flag has been set.  The default if False.
#enable_object_processing: False
#   When set to True gcode files will be run through a "preprocessor"
#   during metadata extraction if object tags are detected.  This preprocessor
#   replaces object tags with G-Code commands compatible with Klipper's
#   "cancel object" functionality.  Note that this process is file I/O intensive,
#   it is not recommended for usage on low resource SBCs such as a Pi Zero.
#   The default is False.
#enable_inotify_warnings: True
#   When set to True Moonraker will generate warnings when inotify attempts
#   to add a duplicate watch or when inotify encounters an error.  On some
#   file systems inotify may not work as expected, this gives users the
#   option to suppress warnings when necessary.  The default is True.

#[machine]
#provider: systemd_dbus
#   The provider implementation used to collect system service information
#   and run service actions (ie: start, restart, stop).  This can be "none",
#   "systemd_dbus", or "systemd_cli".  If the provider is set to "none" service
#   action APIs will be disabled.  The default is systemd_dbus.
#sudo_password:
#   The password for the linux user.  When set Moonraker can run linux commands
#   that require elevated permissions.  This option accepts Jinja2 Templates,
#   see the [secrets] section for details.  It is strongly recommended to only
#   set this option when required and to use the aforementioned secrets module
#   when doing so.  The default is no sudo password is set.
#validate_service:
#   Enables validation of Moonraker's systemd service unit.  If Moonraker
#   detects that a change is necessary it will attempt to do so.  Custom
#   installations and installations that do systemd should set this to False.
#   The default is True.
#validate_config:
#   Enables validation of Moonraker's configuration.  If Moonraker detects
#   deprecated options it will attempt to correct them.  The default is True.
#force_validation:
#   By default Moonraker will not attempt to revalidate if a previous attempt
#   at validation successfully completed. Setting this value to True will force
#   Moonraker to perform validation.  The default is False.

#[database]
#   !!! Note: This section no long has configuration options. Previously the
#   database_path option was used to determine the locatation of the database
#   folder, it is now determined by the data path configured on the command line.

#[data_store]
#temperature_store_size: 1200
#   The maximum number of temperature values to store for each sensor. Note
#   that this value also applies to the "target", "power", and "fan_speed"
#   if the sensor reports them.  The default is 1200, which is enough to
#   store approximately 20 minutes of data at one value per second.
#gcode_store_size:  1000
#   The maximum number "gcode lines" to store.  The default is 1000.

#[job_queue]
#load_on_startup: False
#   When set to true the job queue will attempt to load the next
#   pending job when Klipper reports as "Ready".  If the queue has
#   been paused it will automatically resume.  Note that neither
#   the job_transition_delay nor the job_transition_gcode are
#   applied in this case.  The default is False.
#automatic_transition: False
#   When set to True the queue will automatically transition to
#   the next job in the queue after the current job is complete.
#   This is useful for belt printers and other machines with the
#   ability to automate clearing of the build area.  When False
#   the queue will be paused after each job is loaded, requiring
#   that users manually resume to load the next print.  The default
#   is False.
#job_transition_delay:
#   The amount of time to delay after completion of a job before
#   loading the next job on the queue.  The default is no delay.
#job_transition_gcode:
#   A gcode to execute after the completion of a job before the next
#   job is loaded.  If a "job_transition_delay" has been configured
#   this gcode will run after the delay.  The default is no gcode.

[announcements]
subscriptions:
    mainsail
#   A newline separated list announcement "subscriptions".  Generally
#   this would refer to specific clients that are registered to provide
#   announcements.  All items specified here are added in addition to

#   is no additional subscriptions.
#dev_mode: False
#   A developer option that fetches RSS announcements from a local folder when

#location: printer
#   A description of the webcam location, ie: what the webcam is observing.
#   The default is "printer".

#   ends may use this configuration to determine how to launch or start the
#   program.  The default is "mjpegstreamer".
#target_fps: 15
#   An integer value specifying the target framerate.  The default is 15 fps.
#stream_url:
#   The url for the camera stream request.  This may be a full url or a
#   relative path (ie: /webcam?action=stream) if the stream is served on the
#   same host as Moonraker at port 80.  This parameter must be provided.
#snapshot_url:
#   The url for the camera snapshot request.  This may be a full url or a
#   relative path (ie: /webcam?action=stream) if the stream is served on the
#   same host as Moonraker at port 80.  This parameter must be provided.
#flip_horizontal: False
#   A boolean value indicating whether the stream should be flipped
#   horizontally.  The default is false.

    #192.168.0.0/16
    FE80::/10
    ::1/128
    #192.168.50.0/24

#   A list of newline separated ip addresses, ip ranges, or fully qualified
#   domain names that are trusted. Trusted clients are given full access to
#   the API.  Both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and ranges are supported. Ranges
#   must be expressed in CIDR notation (see http://ip.sb/cidr for more info).
#   For example, an entry of 192.168.1.0/24 will authorize IPs in the range of
#   192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.254.  Note that when specifying IPv4 ranges the
#   last segment of the ip address must be 0. The default is no clients are
#   trusted.
cors_domains:
    #*://*.lan
    *://*.local
    #*://my.mainsail.xyz
    #*://app.fluidd.xyz
#   Enables CORS for the specified domains.  One may specify * if they wish
#   to allow all domains, however this should be an option reserved for
#   client developers and not used in production.  A * can also be used
#   to specify a wildcard that matches several domains.  For example:
#     *.local
#     http://*.my-domain.com
#     *.my-domain.com:*
#   Are all valid entries.  However, a wildcard may not be specified in
#   the top level domain:
#      http://my-printer.*
#   The above example will be rejected.
#   When CORS is enabled by adding an entry to this option, all origins
#   matching the "trusted_clients" option will have CORS headers set as
#   well.  If this option is not specified then CORS is disabled.
#force_logins: False
#   When set to True a user login is required for authorization if at least
#   one user has been created, overriding the "trusted_clients" configuration.
#   If no users have been created then trusted client checks will apply.
#   The default is False.
